### User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view and buy succulents. I want to be able to login into my account. I should also be able to send the owner email about my desire preferences of my purchased, type, weight, size, decoration, and instructions to take care of my plant. If the user choose a desire plant, It should be able to send me to the pay pall account buying options.
